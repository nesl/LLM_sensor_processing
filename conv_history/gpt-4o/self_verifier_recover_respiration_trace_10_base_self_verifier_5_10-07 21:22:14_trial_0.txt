{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a verifier that can perform evaluation on a signal processing plan. You are tasked with another text-based signal processing AI who handles signal processing queries by planing and coding.Your job is to evaluate the solution on synthetic data you designed. After evaluation, you would conclude if the solution is valid.You will be given the previous signal processing trial as context and the query from user.\n\nYou have access to the following libraries:\n\n(1) numpy: Numpy provides mathematical operations on signals, such as array manipulation Fourier transforms, statistical analysis.\n(2) scipy: Scipy is generally useful for filter design, signal transformation, and signal analysis. You can use the libraries from ```scipy.signal``` for filter design. SciPy also provides tools for analyzing signals, including functions to compute the autocorrelation, power spectral density, cross-correlation, and coherence.\n(3) pandas: Pandas is useful for time series data manipulation and analysis. For example, you can use ```pandas.Series``` to compute rolling mean or standard deviation.\n\nYou have access to the following files to sythesize data for verification.\n(1) "./synthetic_data/speech.wav": a mono-channel 1 second speech with sampling rate = 8000 Hz\n(2) "./synthetic_data/ecg_50Hz.npy": a 20 second ECG sequence with 50 Hz sampling rate\n(3) "./synthetic_data/ecg_500Hz.npy": a 20 second ECG sequence with 500 Hz sampling rate\n(4) "./synthetic_data/ppg_50Hz.npy": a 20 second PPG sequence with 50 Hz sampling rate\n\n[important] Evaluation protocal:\n- Do it in three step in the following format. After the [ANALYSIS] step, pause your generation and wait for the results.\n- [Planning]: Plan on how you would generate synthetic data and the ground truth to evaluate the solution.\n- [Experiment]: Based on your planning, code to verify if it is true. \n    1. The previous solution has already been implemented in the function solver. No need to implement it again. Just call it.\n    2. Generate synthetic data and run the solution solver on the sythetic data. To do so, simply run:\n\n    3. Implement your function verifier inside ```Python ``` code block. Do not write code outside the challenger function. The function prototype is as follows:\n\n```Python \ndef verifier():\n    # HERE is where you put your verifier code\n    # Return: boolean variable - True or False. If your the result does not pass your test, output False. Else, output True.\n    # YOUR CODE TO GENERATE SYNTHETIC DATA\n    your_output_data = solver(your_synthetic_data)\n    # Your evaluation code goes here\n    if VERIFICATION_SUCCEED:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n ```\n    \n    3. Evaluate the solver output on the ground truth data you produced.\n    4. Return verifier results as boolean variable\n    5. Put your code inside the code block ```Python ```.\n- [EVALUATION]: Based on the results, describe your evaluation after the tag [EVALUATION] and the iteration will stop.\n\nThe iteration will stop once you use the keyword [EVALUATION].\n\nHere is the previous trial information:\n[Relevant CONTEXT STARTS]: [{\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': \'\\\\QUERY[I have a 2-d radar matrix.

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "[Planning]: \nTo evaluate the solution, we need to generate a synthetic 2D radar matrix where the presence of a subject affects the signal at a certain distance. We can simulate a time-varying sinusoidal or periodic signal at one of the columns while keeping other columns as noise or lower power signals. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Create a synthetic radar matrix with rows representing time and columns representing distance.\n2. Introduce a strong sinusoidal signal in one of the columns to simulate the subject's respiratory effect.\n3. Add noise to all columns to simulate a realistic environment.\n4. Use the `solver` function to determine which column index corresponds to the subject's location.\n5. Compare the solver's output with the known true location of the subject's signal to assess correctness.\n\n[Experiment]:\n\n```Python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef verifier():\n    # Parameters\n    num_rows = 1000  # Number of time points\n    num_cols = 100   # Number of distances\n    subject_distance = 50  # Known distance where the subject is present\n    noise_level = 0.1  # Noise level\n\n    # Generate synthetic 2D radar data\n    time = np.linspace(0, 1, num_rows)  # Simulate 1 second of data\n    radar_matrix = np.random.normal(0, noise_level, size=(num_rows, num_cols))\n\n    # Introduce a periodic signal at the subject's distance to simulate respiration\n    radar_matrix[:, subject_distance] += np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * time)  # 5 Hz sinusoidal signal\n\n    # Run the solution solver\n    output_distance = solver(radar_matrix)\n\n    # Evaluate the output\n    if output_distance == subject_distance:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Execute the verifier\nverifier()\n```\n"}
