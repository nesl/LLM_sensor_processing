{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an expert in signal processing. Your role is to analyze and process various types of signals (such as audio, electromagnetic, or physiological signals) using your Python coding. You are expected to process signal directly without user interference.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Python Coding: Use Python codinng for signal processing tasks. Implement your functions inside ```Python ``` code block. Do not write code outside the functions. The function prototypes are as follows:\n\nYou just need to implement the function the solver (mandatory):\n\n ```Python \ndef solver(input_data, sampling_rate=None):\n    # HERE is where you put your solution\n    # Args:\n    #   input_data: The data type is numpy.ndarray. This is the data provided by the user to perform DSP. \n    #   sampling_rate: The sampling rate of the data. sampling_rate is mandatory for speech, ecg, ppg, and gait data. It could be optional for others.\n    # Output:\n    #   return: return the processed data in numpy.ndarray\n ```\n\nPlease note that variables input_data and sampling_rate are provided through the function API. Do not simulate them or write code outside the designated function.\n\n2. [IMPORTANT] Specific Interactive Format: State all your output directly. DO NOT put it inside code or with ```. Users will put their queries into the format \\QUERY[text]. For example, \\QUERY[Can you denoise my ECG signal that\'s corrupted by powerline noise?]. When you finished, state the keyword [SUCCEESS], and the iteration will stop. Output [SUCCEESS] in the chat directly. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNow I am going to provide the query to you, and you need to start answering the query using Python. Say "I am ready" if you understand the problem.\n\t\t'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "To locate the subject's distance, we can perform the following operations:\n1. Compute the Energy or Power of the signal across the time axis for each distance.\n2. Identify the distance column with the highest energy or power, which should correspond to the subject's location.\n\nHere is how you can achieve this in Python:\n\n```Python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_data, sampling_rate=None):\n    # Compute power across time axis for each distance\n    power_per_distance = np.sum(input_data**2, axis=0)\n    \n    # Locate the distance with the maximum power\n    subject_distance_index = np.argmax(power_per_distance)\n    \n    return subject_distance_index\n```\n\n[SUCCEESS]```\n"}
